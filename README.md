# Pareto Chart
The following code is written as an example to generate Pareto charts using Pandas.
Required packages are pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.

A Pareto Chart is a useful data visualization to present defects data.
It ranks the defects from high to low.
The ranking can be in number of occurences (i.e. frequency) or a different metric.

In this example we look at the total scrapped value of repair parts over the course of a year.
The example data is randomly generated and is not based on a real life example, but it works for demonstration purposes.
